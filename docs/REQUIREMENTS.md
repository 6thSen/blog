# REQUIREMENTS

## SKILL & KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENTS
Did we already mention you will need to read a lot? Well then, you absolutely need to read a lot. But learning is not a chore, it's a privilege!

Here is a list of the minimum skills that you will have to know to start working on our particular project:

- ### Proper Behavior
  As contributors, we are bound by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Everyone is expected to strictly abide by it. Please read and understand the Covenant and take it into heart.

- ### Markdown and Proper Writing Techniques `GREAT FOR NEWBIES`
  If you want to contribute articles and documentation, you have to know Markdown.

  Markdown is the least intimidating skill to learn among those listed here. It can be a good starting point for the absolute beginner.

  You will also need to practice good writing. This is not a strict requirement but it is highly encouraged. Being able to communicate clearly is a very useful skill in almost every situation.

- ### HTML, CSS, Javascript `GOOD FOR NEWBIES TOO`
  If you plan on working on the backend of the blog, you will need to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Luckily, [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) offers a [curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map) especially designed for web development.

- ### React and ES6 `FOR THE ADVANCED DEVELOPERS`
  If you plan on working on the appearance (front-end UI) of the blog, you will need to learn React too.

  React is a front-end Javascript library being developed by Facebook. It is easy and fun to work with.

  ES6 is the next generation Javascript that is being used by React. Most believe that ES6 is so much easier than the old Javascript that we have come to know.
