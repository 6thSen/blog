# WHY CONTRIBUTE?
Let us get straight to the point.

## Your Github profile serves as a modern day resumé.

Nowadays, employers don't look much into the resumé of old. Most of them will ask for your Github profile. Why? Because a Github profile doesn't lie, that's why.

This project aims to jumpstart everyone in building a good Github profile.

In the process, all contributors will learn the essentials in working on an open source web project, from Git to Github to command line to Markdown to HTML/CSS/JS.

## Are you an absolute beginner? No need to worry.

We will try to make this project as beginner-friendly as possible and will tag _issues_ (more on this later) that are easy to resolve as [`NEWBIE-FRIENDLY`](https://github.com/FCCManila/blog/labels/NEWBIE%20FRIENDLY).

And, of course, our Facebook community will be more than willing to assist. Just hop on to https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.manila.
