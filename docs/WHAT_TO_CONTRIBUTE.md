# WHAT TO CONTRIBUTE

## ARTICLES

Blog posts and articles can be added in the `pages` folder.

- Inside `pages` folder, create a sub-folder and name it in the following format: `YYYY-mm-dd-title-of-article` (e.g. `2017-01-01-hello-world`)

- Inside that sub-folder, create `index.md` (if you prefer to use simple markdown) or `index.js` (if you intend to use HTML/React/JS in your article)

- All of your article's supporting files (i.e. photos) should be stored inside the article's sub-folder.

- For article format, refer to `samples` folder.
