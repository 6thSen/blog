# WHAT TO CONTRIBUTE

To jumpstart your way into contributing in the project, you may immediately head to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/FCCManila/blog/issues) and find an [_issue_](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) you may want to work on.

**Are you an absolute beginner?** Watch out for issues with the [`NEWBIE-FRIENDLY`](https://github.com/FCCManila/blog/labels/NEWBIE%20FRIENDLY) label.

Here are a few of the things you can contribute to our project:

- Articles
- Documentation
- Design and Layout
- Tests and Lints
- Issues
- Others

## ARTICLES

Create, edit, and proofread blog posts and articles. This is a great way for newbies to jump right in and contribute.

Articles are the single most important content that this project will contain.

Topics may range from your own experiences in trying to learn how to program, difficulties you may have encountered and how you solved them, knowledge you may want to share, new technologies that you have discovered, etc.

Blog posts and articles can be added in the `pages` folder:

- Inside `pages` folder, create a sub-folder and name it in the following format: `YYYY-mm-dd-title-of-article` (e.g. `2017-01-01-hello-world`)

- Inside that sub-folder, create `index.md` (if you prefer to use simple markdown) or `index.js` (if you intend to use HTML/React/JS in your article)

- All of your article's supporting files (i.e. photos) should be stored inside the article's sub-folder.

- For article format, refer to `samples` folder.

## DOCUMENTATION

Create, edit, and proofread repository documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and files found in `docs` folder).

Success of an open source project largely depends on the quality of the repository's documentation. The documentation will aid anyone interested in being a contributor. They serve as virtual _training wheels_ so to speak.

## DESIGN AND LAYOUT

Change the appearance and layout of visual components on the blog. Improve the UI/UX.

Most files related to the blog's design and layout are usually found in `components`, `css`, and `wrappers` folders.

You may also take a look at `pages\_template.js`, `pages\_index.js`, and `pages\404.md` files.

## TESTS AND LINTS

Unit testing, integration testing, and linting are integral parts in any development environment. Right now, there is no standard being followed for tests yet.

Currently, only markdown and JS linting is in place, albeit they have a very large room for improvement.

## ISSUES

You can even file an issue (i.e. bugs, feature requests, enhancement requests, blog topic suggestions) for everyone to work on.

By filing an issue, you have already made a [Github contribution](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/)! How amazing is that?

What is an issue anyway? [Here is a short read for you](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

You can file issues in the [Issues Page](https://github.com/FCCManila/blog/issues).

## OTHERS

If you are an advanced developer, we're sure you'll find something in the codebase you can tinker with. Major areas for enhancement include customization of Gatsby and React for the blog's unique purposes, installation of additional useful NPM packages and tools, etc. Let your imagination and magic run wild!
